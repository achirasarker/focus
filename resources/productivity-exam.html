    <h2 class="title">Tips for Exams and Summatives</h2>
    <p>It's that time of the year again, the sun is shining, the weather is great, the flowers are blooming, but best
    of all, exams and summatives are lurking around. Exams and culminating projects can be stressful and not fun, to
  say the least. But I've heard that they're somewhat actually important, so here are some tips on how to do well!</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For culminating projects, it's a good idea to start early. As tempting as it is to procrastinate, start early
      so that you can finish early.
    </li>
    <br>
      <li>
        Make a study schedule. An exam is an entire semester's worth of material, and making a schedule will help you organize
        your time while ensuring that you cover everything.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Take breaks while studying or working. Studies show that a short 10-15 minute break between every 60-90 minutes of
        study improves concentration, memory and overall productivity.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Ask your teacher for help. Asking for clarification or extra help can only benefit you.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        The night before, get a good night of sleep. At least nine hours of sleep is recommended. Sleep deprivation
        can hurt your memory and overall performance on an exam.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        On the morning of an exam, you may want to wake up early to study. Some people find it easier to study and memorize
        information in the morning, after sleeping.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        It is important to eat a healthy, nutritious breakfast on the day of an exam. For instance, you could have a smoothie,
        an omelette on toast, or oatmeal.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p class="last-para">Hopefully, these tips and tricks will help you ace your exams and culminating projects. Good luck!</p>
