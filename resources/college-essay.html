  <h2 class="title">Personal Essay</h2>
  <p>Many programs require you to write an essay about yourself or a preferred topic. While there's different ways
    to approach the essay prompt, here are a couple of tips that are important to follow when writing any essay:</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Be Truthful</h4>
  <p>Trust me, your writing will seem far more better if the thoughts come from you. Speak about
    your accomplishments, what you believe in, what your goals are. In a pile of hundreds of essays, your essay
    will definitely be very special because every single one of you have your own, unique story. You don't need to have started
    20 clubs or invent something groundbreaking. Remember, speak about you.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Be Succint</h4>
  <p>Personal essays come with a limited amount of characters to begin with, so be thoughtful with all the
    points you're including because you don't want to waste space. That goes the other way too, don't try to sugarcoat
    the essay in hopes of fulfilling the character count by putting any irrelavent points in there. The admissions commitee
    already has access to your grades, tell them something they don't know. Remember, the essay is the only way they can get
    a glimpse of <em>you</em> for who you truly are.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Don't go Overboard</h4>
  <p>If you're a funny person, that's great! You can use that to your advantage by making the essay more
    funny or creative, but don't go overboard. Too many jokes can take away from the overall professionalism of the essay.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Edit!</h4>
  <p>This is one of the most important steps for any piece of writing. You spent so long crafting an essay, so
    why put all that hard work to waste in the final step? Polish and clean up your essay. Make sure that you doublecheck
    the punctuation, spelling, and formatting so that it can be easily read and understood by the reader.</p>
