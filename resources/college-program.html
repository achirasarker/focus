  <h2 class="title">Choosing the Right Program</h2>
  <p>Ah, the the time has finally arrived. Picking a program for college. You’ve spent the last 12 years of your
    life at school and now it’s time for even more schooling (<em>fun right?</em>), except this time, the subjects you
    take could end up determining your future. For some students, they’ve known what they wanted to be from
    a young age, but for others, the decision wasn’t an easy one to make. </p>
  <br>
  <p>In my case, it was the latter. All my life, I’ve wanted to go into the field of medicine. I constantly
    researched about the field and even began volunteering at a hospital because I felt so passionate about
    it. All that was on my mind was that I wanted to help people and make a real impact in their lives,
    but I realized soon enough that being a physician isn’t the only way to achieve that goal. There’s
    so many ways I can work with technology to help people in the medical field provide the best care
    to patients. So, a year before college applications, I decided I wanted to change my subject to
    engineering.</p>
  <br>
  <p>There’s lots of things that influenced my decision and here’s a couple of questions you should ask
    yourself before picking you own program:
    <br>
  <p><strong>•What makes you happy?</strong> Everyone has certain courses they love, what are yours? Your strongest courses
    aren't necessarily your favourite. Think about the one thing that you wouldn't mind learning about for hours. Is it the human body? Stock market? Physics theories?
    Your major interests can be linked to a certain college major. If you're unsure, there's many online quizzes you can
    take, such as this <a href="https://play.howstuffworks.com/quiz/this-comprehensive-quiz-will-determine-your-ideal-college-major">
      HowStuffWorks quiz</a> or <a href="https://brainfall.com/quizzes/which-college-major-should-you-be/">Brainfall quiz</a>.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p><strong>•What are ur strengths?</strong> Are you performing particularly well in a course? That could be a hint. However,
    even if you're doing well, what matters most is how much you enjoy that course.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p class="last-para"><strong>•What are your goals?</strong> This comes down to many factors. Where do you see yourself 10 years from now?
    What are your expectations,salary-wise and about employment rates in that field? How many years of school are you willing
    to take?</p>
