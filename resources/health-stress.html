  <p>School can get stressful, on top all of our other responsibilities. We would be lying if we said that we never cried
    over schoolwork. Here are some tips for relieving that stress:</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Get Sleep</h4>
  <p>Even if you think you can pull through an all-nighter, your body does not. Stress can cause you to lose sleep, but it could also be the other way around.
    The lack of sleep could also make you stressed. To avoid this altogether, try to get your sleep! The recommended amount
    is 7-8 hours, but as students, we can collectively agree that often, this is too good to be true. Despite so, do try
    to get as much sleep as possible because a healthy mind can only benefit you. Instead of sacrificing your sleep to study the
    night before a test, save yourself the last-minute stress by managing your time wisely.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Exercise (every effort counts!)</h4>
  <p>You may not have time to go to the gym, but you can incorporate exercise into your daily routine. Whether it be a ten minute
    walk or a quick morning stretch, your body will thank you. Your body releases endorphins when you get your blood moving,
    which can improve your mood and relieve some of the stress.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Eat Right</h4>
  <p>When we're stressed, it can be so tempting to grab a bag of chips as a snack, but we all know that fatty or sugary food aren't
    very helpful for our body. A not-so-healthy diet isn't going to make the stress disappear. Make the right choice and choose an
    healthier option, like a fruit or vegetable.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Talk to a Friend</h4>
  <p>Take a break to call or chat with a friend. Hearing another person's voice, can be very reassuring. It can help you feel better,
    as well as take some of the stress off your shoulders.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Listen to Music</h4>
  <p>Sometimes, music can be our best friend. Listening to music can make you feel calm and relaxed. When I feel stressed, my
    personal favourites are piano or violin, but use whatever works best for you!</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Plan Ahead</h4>
  <p>There's hundred of deadlines being thrown at you, and naturally, this can make you feel overwhelmed. However, if you
    plan out how you're going to approach them, it can relieve a lot of the unwanted stress. This can be as simple as marking
    on your calender how and when you'll accomplish your tasks.</p>
