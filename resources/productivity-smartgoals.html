  <h2 class="title">Setting SMART Goals</h2>
  <p>You may or may not have heard about SMART goals. These are an extremely useful way of not only planning your goals, but
    also being accountable for them and tracking your progress. Setting SMART goals can help you use your time and resources
    wisely and productively, while bettering your chances of accomplishing them. The following guide will help you setting your
    goals:</p>
  <br>

  <p>1) <strong>S</strong>pecific - If your goals are clear and specific, then you can focus all your efforts on it and be
    motivated to work towards them. Ask yourself the following:
  <ul>
    <li>What do I want to achive?</li>
    <li>Who does it involve?</li>
    <li>Why does this goal matter to me?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>


  <p>2) <strong>M</strong>easurable - By setting measurable goals, you can track your progress over time and stay focused
    You'll know exactly how far you have to go till you reach it. Ask yourself the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How much (time, money, resources etc.) will it take?</li>
    <li>How will I know when I've accomplished it?</li>
  </ul>


  <p>3) <strong>A</strong>chievable - In order to be successful, your goals should be realistic and attainable. Challenge
    yourself to go beyond, but remember that there are limits. There are some things that you don't have much control
    over, such as financial factors, but work towards achieving what you can. Ask yourself the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How realistic is the goal, considering constraint factors e.g. financials?</li>
    <li>How can I achieve it?</li>
  </ul>


  <p>4) <strong>R</strong>elevant - Make sure that your goal matters to you and that it's something you are willing to
    dedicate time and resources to. At the end of the day, no matter how many people are helping you, you are your
    own boss and you are responsible for achieving your goal. Ask yourself the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does this seem worthwhile?</li>
    <li>Will it make me happy?</li>
    <li>Is now the right time for it?</li>
  </ul>


  <p>5) <strong>T</strong>ime-bound - When we get assignments, we get a deadline with it so that we know how much time we
    will have to finish it. Similarily, every goal needs a deadline, or a target time that we wish to complete it. Ask
    yourself the following:
  <ul>
    <li>How far will I be with it 5 weeks from now? 5 months?</li>
    <li>What can I currently do for it?</li>
  </ul>
